# My data pipeline from Roam

## Context

I see myself usign a lot roam lately, notes, thoughts, calendar... is like my center of thought creation. 

And would be nice, if I have not to move part of it to other tools.


## Blog

Right now my blog https://allocsoc.net use hugo, so one way of blogging is to just write into Roam, and have
specific tag in the metadata/reference first node
