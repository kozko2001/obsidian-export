# Roam export 

This is a dirty cli to export my obsidian files stored in a dropbox folder

## install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Run it

set the correct env variables:

1. You need to create a new app in dropbox https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
2. Generate your own Access token
3. Make sure you have the env variable `DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`
4. run `node index.js`
